Babylon.js EditorToolkit for Unity3D
====================================

Please visit our main documentation site: https://doc.babylonjs.com/communityExtensions/Unity/Intro

Note: The toolkit requires Unity 2020.1 or greater. 

Newtonsoft Json.NET
====================

Unity 2020.3 and greater now ship with Newtonsoft Json.NET.
If your Unity project already includes Json.NET, you may get errors in the Unity Console due to
duplicate function/class definitions. In most cases, removing the Babylon Toolkit copy of the of
the Json folder (**Assets/[Babylon]/Plugins/Json**) should solve the issue.
